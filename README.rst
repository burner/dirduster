Description
===========

DirDuster is a web directory bruteforcing tool similar to DirBuster.
It allows you to quickly check for the presence of files or directories in
order to detect potential flaws in the way the web server is configured.

Why DirDuster?
==============

The main tool used for this task is DirBuster_ which is written in Java and
uses a graphical interface. This makes it hard enough to use for me to prefer
writting another tool with a more proper interface.

There also exist dirb_ but it doesn't allow the user to specify the number of
threads which means a massive slowdown on my machine which wasn't acceptable
anymore.

Known bugs
==========

For some reason when using requests with lots of threads some messages about
failed connections pop on stderr. I don't know why right now but the
connection still ends up being done so you can safely ignore it for the
moment.
