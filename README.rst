Description
===========

DirDuster is a web directory bruteforcing tool similar to DirBuster.
It allows you to quickly check for the presence of files or directories in
order to detect potential flaws in the way the web server is configured.

Why DirDuster?
==============

The main tool used for this task is DirBuster_ which is written in Java and
uses a graphical interface. This makes it hard enough to use for me to prefer
writting another tool with a more proper interface.

There also exist dirb_ but it doesn't allow the user to specify the number of
threads which means a massive slowdown on my machine which wasn't acceptable
anymore.

How can I change the user-agent or use basic authentication?
============================================================

Setup custom headers using the --header option:

::

    dirduster -H "User-Agent=Whatever,Basic=YTphCg==" -f pathlist.txt test.com

For basic authentication you can also use the --auth option.

  support any besides GET and POST.
